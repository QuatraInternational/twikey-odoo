                   <h2>A recurring payment service provider</h2>
                   <p>The Twikey plugin provides a convenient integration with Twikey, <strong>a payment service provider specializing in
                       recurring payments and payments for returning customers</strong>.</p>
                   <p>Installing the Twikey plugin in Odoo allows an automated and efficient financial workflow whether
                       you use the e-commerce functionality of Odoo through your online shop or use Odoo as an invoice generation tool, this
                       plugin allows you as well as your customer to make the payment process as painless as possible. It does this in several
                       ways:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li><strong>Invite your customers to a recurring payment method</strong> whether it's via direct debit or credit card reducing your
                           financial costs as well as improving your cash flow as the predictable nature of recurring payments (and direct debit
                           in particular) allows businesses to accurately forecast and plan their incoming cash flow.</li>
                       <li>Mandate Management: Twikey offers a comprehensive solution for <strong>managing mandates</strong>. With the Twikey plugin, merchants
                           can efficiently handle the creation, modification, and cancellation of mandates directly from within Odoo. This
                           simplifies mandate management and ensures compliance with relevant regulations.</li>
                       <li>The existing Sepa mandates as well as any recurring credit card your customer can be used for <strong>registering payments</strong>
                           either in a customer flow in the online show or when you're on your monthly billing run. The heavy lifting of sending
                           the transactions to one or more banks or downstream payment providers is being done in Twikey where you can configure
                           how those transactions are finally sent to either one or more banks/payment providers.</li>
                       <li>Direct Debit Payments: Via Twikey's gateway to multiple banks, the transactions can be directly retrieved from their
                           customer's bank accounts <strong>without the need to ever download/upload files in your bank environment</strong>.</li>
                       <li>A Twikey Provider is available in the list of <strong>Odoo payment providers</strong>, giving your customers a transparent and easy way
                           for future purchases. This lowers the bar making the purchases on your website even easier. The provider can be used
                           for tokenized methods as well as for one-off payments. As some of your customers might not want to pay every invoice
                           in an automated way (e.g. setup invoices)</li>
                       <li>The plugin also reduces the operational overhead by <strong>leveraging the reconciliation engine of Odoo</strong> as well as
                           providing the reconciliation files for use in third-party accounting software, reducing the need for manual
                           intervention and minimizing errors. This automation saves time and resources, allowing businesses to focus on core
                           activities while maintaining accurate and up-to-date payment records.</li>
                       <li>The plugin synchronizes payment information between Twikey and Odoo, enabling businesses to
                           maintain accurate records and monitor the status of payments. This simplifies the reconciliation process even further
                           and enhances financial visibility.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>In summary, installing the Twikey plugin in Odoo provides customers with a comprehensive solution for recurring
                       payment management, mandate handling, and automation. It streamlines payment processes, improves operational efficiency,
                       and facilitates seamless integration with Odoo's existing functionalities.</p>

                   <h2>Configuration</h2>
                   <p>Configuration is really straightforward. Once the plugin is installed, head to the settings and paste the api url and key you copied
                   from the <a href="//www.twikey.com/r/admin/#/c/settings/api">Twikey Api settings</a>.</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Be sure to test the connectivity ensuring there is no network issue between your odoo environment and Twikey</li>
                       <li>Synchronise the Twikey profiles so you can start using the plugin right a way</li>
                       <li>[Only for ecommerce] Head to "Payment providers" and duplicate the default while setting the correct profile and payment method.
                       Note: be sure to enable the payment method in the profile on Twikey side as it is doing a direct call to the
                           <a href="//www.twikey.com/api/#sign-a-mandate">sign api</a></li>
                   </ul>
